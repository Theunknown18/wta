    <h2>Purple Cap</h2>
    <p>
The Purple Cap is one of the most prestigious awards in the Indian Premier League, presented to the bowler with the highest number of wickets in the tournament. 
It is undoubtedly a huge achievement for any bowler as the title not only showcases your sheer determination throughout the championship, but also places you as a brilliant bowler in the T20 format because of the level of cricket displayed in the league.
Hence, it's like a golden ticket for bowlers to come into the eyes of the right people and accelerate their cricketing career. The competition has seen some exceptional performances from individuals who won the Purple Cap at the end of the season.
For the first time since its inception. The award earned a title sponsor in the form of Saudi Aramco last year. Rajasthan Royalsâ€™ leggie Yuzvendra Chahal bagged the first-ever Aramco Purple Cap with 27 wickets in 17 matches which was the first time he won this title in his IPL career.
